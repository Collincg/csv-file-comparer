# csv-file-comparer

## About
Program to read 2 separate CSV files with employees in each file. File A contains information on their employment status.
File B contains information on whether or not they have an Office 365 license.
We want all active employees to have a license and all inactive employees to have their licenses removed.
This will help our department avoid having to purchase more licenses than required.
Program used by Rice County, Minnesota.
